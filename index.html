            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Coding is increasingly recognized as a vital skill, enabling individuals to interact with technology while fostering essential abilities like problem-solving, creativity, and critical thinking. These skills are applicable across various industries, making coding education crucial for future career success. Python, one of the most commonly taught programming languages in schools, is particularly favored due to its ease of learning and versatility.</p>
            <p>At FEU Alabang, students' proficiency in Python is evaluated through discussions, hands-on projects, and exams. However, challenges exist; weekly classes may hinder engagement and retention of information. While hands-on projects enhance learning, they may not fully assess students' understanding of coding concepts. Additionally, exams often prioritize memorization over practical application of knowledge.</p>
            <p>To address these challenges, our research proposes the development of a quiz game website aimed at assessing studentsâ€™ Python skills in an engaging manner. This platform will evaluate competencies in key areas such as coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and technical terminology comprehension. By making learning interactive and enjoyable, the quiz game will not only test existing knowledge but also encourage skill improvement. The ultimate goal is to create a motivating tool that enhances students' learning experiences in Python programming.</p>
